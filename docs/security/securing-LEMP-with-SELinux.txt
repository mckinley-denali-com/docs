Securing a LEMP stack web server with SELinux

SELinux can protect system resources (such as files and TCP sockets) from being illegitimately accessed. The victims of cyber security breaches usually regret switching it off. 

- set correct SELinux labels on the web server document directory tree and server configuration files
- create SELinux modules to allow access to TCP sockets
- test your configuration
etc.
